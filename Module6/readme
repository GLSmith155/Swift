Create an app for a late-model iPhone that has two scenes and two view controllers, one per scene. The first scene, which runs on startup, should have a slider that you set to a value between 0 (all the way to the left) and 100 (all the way to the right). There should be a button that is labelled “Display slider value”. When you click it, you should go to  the second scene,  which should be a modal view, in which there is “Back” button in a button bar at the top (use a navigation controller), and a text field below it  labelled “slider value:” which initially shows the value of the slider from the first scene. The user may edit the text field. If the value in the text field is a valid integer between 0 and 100 at the time the user presses the back  button, the slider should show the value that the user entered. If the user enters a value outside that range, or that is not an integer, the slider should keep the value it had at the time of the segue to scene two, and a message should be printed (in a label on the first scene) “Invalid slider value entered”.  You should use constraints to position the various user interface elements, but only worry about the (wC hR) class.
